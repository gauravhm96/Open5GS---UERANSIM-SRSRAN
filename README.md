# 5G-SA system using Open5GS with 2 different 5G-RAN's ie. SRSRAN and UERANSIM.

### Project Description 

Understanding fundamental design principles of 5G Architecture as a Service Based Architecture(SBA) and realize Network Function Instances and interactions virtually.

The task is to impliment open5GS setup virtually using 2 different 5G-RAN's which are SRSRAN and UERANSIM. Also to provide specific functonality to different tenants with concept such as network slicing with UERANSIM.

- This projects implimentation is divided into 3 parts as following:
